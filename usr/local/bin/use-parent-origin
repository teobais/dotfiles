# This script can be used in case one initially forked a repo, but after some time wants to work directly with the parent origin. The latter requires the individual to be part of the specific github organisation.
# Replaces upstream with origin, by removing initial origin and renaming upstream to origin.

git remote rm origin
git remote rename upstream origin
